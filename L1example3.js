// Objects
// we won't get deep into these during this lesson.

const family = [
  {
    name: "Theresa",
    relationship: "mother",
  },
  {
    name: "Rick",
    relationship: "father",
  },
];

// Can you notice anything important or interesting about these objects?
// each one has a name and relationship property

// Let's push another family member onto the array
// Someone shout out a name. And a relationship.
// What will happen if I try pushing a number onto the family array? do JS then TS
// What do you think will happen if we try adding another property, such as age? do JS then TS
// We will get into how to annotate object types later on in the module.
